# Code Quiz

## Description

Here's a quiz that will challenge what you know about the basics of web developement.

I built this challenge to bring together what I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I primarily learned about bug fixing. I also learned a bit about how to identify what scope to put different variables in.
